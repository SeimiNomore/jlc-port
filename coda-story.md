Ice Coda wasn’t the kind of delinquent who sought attention—he didn’t need to. His reputation arrived at Park High long before he did, whispered through the hallways like a ghost story. Known throughout Metreon City for his calculated cruelty and unflinching demeanor, Ice wasn’t after fleeting fame or petty rivalries. His ambitions were larger, darker: to transform Park High into the foundation of a citywide empire.  

Coda’s path to infamy began years earlier, shaped by a betrayal of his own making. In middle school, Ice was inseparable from his childhood friend, a boy whose loyalty matched Ice’s own burning ambition. Together, they reigned as kings of their school, an unstoppable force that left their peers in awe and fear. But Ice wanted more. In his mind, power couldn’t be shared—it had to be absolute. One fateful day, Ice challenged his best friend for the crown, defeating him in a brutal fight and breaking his arm even after he surrendered. It was a calculated act of cruelty, meant to send a message to all who dared oppose him. The nickname "Ice" stuck, not just for his cold demeanor but for his ability to shatter anything—or anyone—in his path.  

By the time he entered Park High, Coda’s reputation as an untouchable force had hardened. Unlike the wild, showy fighters who sought attention, Ice was a tactician. He struck with precision, dismantling opponents with surgical efficiency. In the Freshman Battle tournament, he carved through the ranks, leaving behind a trail of battered bodies and whispered warnings. Yet even as he advanced to the second round, Coda was unsatisfied. Yogi had been ambushed by TDFW, forcing a forfeit, and Coda’s victory felt hollow. For someone like Ice, a win without proving superiority wasn’t a win at all.  

When Pooma and Tum-Tum approached Ice for an alliance to take down TDFW, Ice’s acceptance wasn’t out of loyalty or camaraderie. To him, their proposal was merely a tool—a stepping stone toward his ultimate goal. He made it clear: when the dust settled, they would owe him a fight, and there would be no question about who stood at the top.  

Despite his cold, solitary nature, Ice’s tactical brilliance made him an essential part of the group. While Tum-Tum brought raw strength and Yogi embodied wild energy, Ice was the calculating mind behind their strategy. He exploited weaknesses with an almost unnerving calm, his icy stare often defeating opponents before the fight even began. Silas Marks, one of Park High’s upperclassman legends, once remarked, “Fighting Ice isn’t like losing—it’s like never having a chance to win.”  

But beneath the layers of ruthlessness lies something more complex. Ice isn’t driven by chaos or senseless cruelty; he’s chasing control in a world that’s always felt out of his grasp. Raised in the rough streets of Metreon City by a father who was often absent due to work, Ice learned to navigate survival on his own. Fighting wasn’t just a way to rise—it was a way to keep the chaos at bay.  

Now, with the Freshman Battle reaching its climax and TDFW tightening its grip on the school, Ice stands at a crossroads. His vision of turning Park High into a kingdom under his rule is within reach, but the alliances he’s forged—and the grudges he’s created—threaten to topple it all. For Ice Coda, the fight is no longer just about dominance. It’s about proving that control, even in the chaos of Metreon City, can be wrested by sheer will.  

Cold, unrelenting, and dangerously brilliant, Ice Coda is the shadow king of Park High—a figure who commands fear not with noise, but with silence, and whose greatest weapon isn’t his fists, but his mind.
