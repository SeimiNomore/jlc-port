### The Relentless Flame of Park High: Yogi’s Story
___

*Yogi,* the brash, loudmouthed firebrand, strode through the rusted gates of Park High’s All Boys School with a swagger that dared the world to cross him. Known across the city for his volatile temper and penchant for chaos, Yogi had been expelled from nearly every middle school in Metreon. He wasn’t just a troublemaker; he was a name whispered with both fear and awe—a kid who fought like his life depended on it, because, in a way, it did.  

Yogi’s young life was shaped by tragedy. Losing his sister, Enola Raymond, in a horrific accident he witnessed as a child left him with a fractured view of life and death. The event hardened him, and by his first year of middle school, his behavior became erratic and destructive. He skipped classes, picked fights, and hurled insults with reckless abandon. If there was a middle school in Metreon, Yogi had likely been kicked out of it.  

His infamous street reputation began to solidify during those turbulent years. One fight, in particular, stood out: an encounter with Pooma, a fellow troublemaker with a knack for survival. Though details of their clash remain murky, the two emerged with mutual respect—Pooma later described Yogi as *“the one that didn’t stay down.”*  

For Yogi, fighting wasn’t just an outlet; it became his purpose. The adrenaline, the pain, and the triumph filled the void left by his sister’s death. Street brawls became his battlegrounds, and he quickly earned the nickname “The Hothead” for his unpredictable style and unyielding stamina. Yogi’s relentless fighting spirit even landed him in juvenile detention after a scuffle with a police officer—a testament to his refusal to back down from anyone, authority figures included.  

Yogi’s fighting style was as erratic as his personality. He could collapse from exhaustion mid-battle yet still refuse to fall completely. His uncanny ability to recover and learn from each fight made him a force to be reckoned with. Defeats only fueled his hunger for improvement, and with every punch thrown and every blow endured, he grew stronger.  

When the Freshman Battle tournament at Park High began, Yogi saw his chance to channel his raw energy into a singular goal: to claim the title of champion and establish himself as the first undisputed king of the school. But Yogi wasn’t just in it for glory; he had a plan. With a vision of taking on the upperclassmen, he began forming his own faction, preparing for war against the school’s most dangerous opponents.  

Yogi’s rise quickly caught the attention of Silas Marks, the cunning leader of TDFW. Silas, along with his generals Ryder and Ralph, had encountered Yogi during a stint in juvenile detention. Ryder had nearly lost to Yogi’s relentless assault, and Ralph only managed to subdue him with significant effort. The two walked away shaken, dubbing him a “zombie” for his refusal to stay down. Recognizing Yogi’s potential, Silas attempted to recruit him into TDFW’s ranks.  

But Yogi was nobody’s pawn. He refused Silas outright, rejecting any notion of servitude. Insulted and enraged, Silas retaliated with a brutal ambush outside school grounds. Leading TDFW himself, Silas unleashed his gang’s full force on Yogi and his faction. Despite their fierce resistance, the group was overwhelmed by sheer numbers. The assault left Yogi and his comrades hospitalized, disqualifying him from the Freshman Battle and delaying his long-awaited showdown with Silas.  

Yogi’s defeat was a temporary setback, but his spirit remained unbroken. His story was far from over, and Park High was about to learn that even the hardest punches couldn’t extinguish the fire burning inside him.
