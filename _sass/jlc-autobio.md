## **Autobiography of J.L. Christian**  
*An Artist’s Odyssey*  

I’m *J.L. Christian*, an artist shaped by the complexities of my upbringing and inspired by a legacy I couldn’t ignore. My journey into fine art began in 2022, but the seeds were planted long before that. My father, a talented artist in his own right, set the foundation for my creative instincts. Watching him work—seeing how he could turn a blank surface into something alive—was my first real lesson in the power of art.

For years, I felt like his story wasn’t finished. His brushes, canvases, and ideas seemed to be waiting for someone to pick them up and take them further. In 2022, I realized that someone had to be me.

#### The Beginning
I started simple: sketching out ideas, experimenting with different mediums, and figuring out my voice as an artist. But as I kept going, I saw how my work could speak to something bigger than just me. My father’s influence was there from the start, but my art also became a way to express my own experiences—growing up in East Oakland, navigating life, and digging into histories that often go unnoticed.

#### What Drives My Work
My work is deeply personal but always connects to something universal. I’m fascinated by time, history, and the things that leave marks—whether it’s a person, a story, or a place. I use layers in my pieces, both literally and symbolically, to explore those ideas. A lot of my inspiration comes from the things that are forgotten, hidden, or misunderstood.

Each piece I create is a conversation: between my father’s artistic legacy and my own vision, between the past and the present, and between the viewer and the story I’m trying to tell.

#### The Fine Art Path
Since stepping into the fine art world, I’ve learned that this isn’t just about making something beautiful; it’s about creating something lasting. I want my art to challenge people, to make them pause, to look again. Whether it’s a painting, a series, or an idea woven into a larger project, my work always has layers—literal and metaphorical.

*The Gumball Arcade Auction House* is part of that vision, a way to engage collectors and investors in a new way, but my focus remains on the work itself. The art comes first, always.

#### Reflections
When I think about why I do this, it comes back to my father. He gave me the tools—not just the physical ones, but the mindset. He showed me how to see the world differently, and now I’m building on that foundation.

Art is how I leave my mark, how I carry forward what my father started, and how I contribute to something bigger than myself. Every piece I create is part of that story, and I’m just getting started.
