## Artworks Codex | Feb 2019 - Mythos

This was the chapter where I made the conscious decision to prioritize my own growth and well-being. I knew it was time to give back to myself, to nurture that part of me that had been waiting patiently beneath the surface. I embarked on a journey into the depths of my creative expression, embracing the process not just as an artist but as an individual seeking transformation. Through the lens of fine art, I discovered the freedom to explore new techniques, push my boundaries, and fully immerse in the act of creation. This practice became a blend of artistic passion and inner discipline—a space where I could reflect, refine, and rediscover who I am at my core.

Engaging in this way wasn’t just about making art; it was about crafting a life where creativity and mindfulness intertwined, giving me the foundation to express myself with authenticity and purpose.
