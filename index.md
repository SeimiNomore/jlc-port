### Artworks Codex Feb 2019 - present
This was the chapter where I made the conscious decision to prioritize my own growth and well-being. I knew it was time to give back to myself, to nurture that part of me that had been waiting patiently beneath the surface. I embarked on a journey into the depths of my creative expression, embracing the process not just as an artist but as an individual seeking transformation. Through the lens of fine art, I discovered the freedom to explore new techniques, push my boundaries, and fully immerse in the act of creation. This practice became a blend of artistic passion and inner discipline—a space where I could reflect, refine, and rediscover who I am at my core.

Engaging in this way wasn’t just about making art; it was about crafting a life where creativity and mindfulness intertwined, giving me the foundation to express myself with authenticity and purpose.

I4NI: A Testament to Misunderstood Youth
In the intricacies of societal perceptions, I4NI emerges as a profound artistic statement that dissects the veiled interpretations of youth seen through the lens of uncertainty and trepidation. This compelling piece encapsulates the duality of youthful existence—a narrative shaped not by their own truths but by the apprehensions and misapprehensions of those observing from the outside. The title itself, a cryptic expression of “Eye for an Eye,” challenges the viewer to reexamine the reactive, often defensive ways society approaches the unknown.

The Art of Resilience: Kodak Black as the Modern Sweetback
In the luminous canon of Blaxploitation cinema, Melvin Van Peebles’ Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song stands as a defiant, kinetic ode to survival, resistance, and the raw essence of self-determination. It’s within this framework that one can draw a seamless, almost mythical comparison to Kodak Black—a contemporary artist whose life and art form an unscripted narrative of struggle and tenacity. His world reflects the bruised, unfiltered resilience that Sweetback embodied, breathing life into the shared tale of overcoming systemic adversity.

# Art Collectives and Personal Project Outreach
  I collaborated with artists across a range of mediums to support and refine their creative practices. Through these partnerships, I gained hands-on experience in understanding the unique techniques and perspectives that each art form demands. This involvement not only deepened my appreciation for diverse artistic expressions but also enhanced my ability to contribute effectively to creative projects, bridging ideas and execution across various crafts.
