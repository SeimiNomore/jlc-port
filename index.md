#### Artworks Codex Feb 2019 - present
This was the chapter where I made the conscious decision to prioritize my own growth and well-being. I knew it was time to give back to myself, to nurture that part of me that had been waiting patiently beneath the surface. I embarked on a journey into the depths of my creative expression, embracing the process not just as an artist but as an individual seeking transformation. Through the lens of fine art, I discovered the freedom to explore new techniques, push my boundaries, and fully immerse in the act of creation. This practice became a blend of artistic passion and inner discipline—a space where I could reflect, refine, and rediscover who I am at my core.

Engaging in this way wasn’t just about making art; it was about crafting a life where creativity and mindfulness intertwined, giving me the foundation to express myself with authenticity and purpose.

I4NI: A Testament to Misunderstood Youth
In the intricacies of societal perceptions, I4NI emerges as a profound artistic statement that dissects the veiled interpretations of youth seen through the lens of uncertainty and trepidation. This compelling piece encapsulates the duality of youthful existence—a narrative shaped not by their own truths but by the apprehensions and misapprehensions of those observing from the outside. The title itself, a cryptic expression of “Eye for an Eye,” challenges the viewer to reexamine the reactive, often defensive ways society approaches the unknown.

The Art of Resilience: Kodak Black as the Modern Sweetback
In the luminous canon of Blaxploitation cinema, Melvin Van Peebles’ Sweet Sweetback’s Baadasssss Song stands as a defiant, kinetic ode to survival, resistance, and the raw essence of self-determination. It’s within this framework that one can draw a seamless, almost mythical comparison to Kodak Black—a contemporary artist whose life and art form an unscripted narrative of struggle and tenacity. His world reflects the bruised, unfiltered resilience that Sweetback embodied, breathing life into the shared tale of overcoming systemic adversity.

##### Morgan's Last Gig | Collection - Phantom's of Blue

Lee’s journey to becoming an urban legend began with this unyielding (***Love***). It wasn’t just about mastering an instrument; it was about making it speak. He could translate emotion into sound, pulling from the depths of joy, heartache, and everything in between. His trumpet was more than an instrument; it was a medium through which he shared his love for life, jazz, and the culture that surrounded it. The way he played was personal, almost as if he was having a conversation with each listener, drawing them into a shared experience of rhythm and soul.

#### Game Development

##### Case study - BPH Battle Park High

*Battle Park High Overview*

*Battle Park High* is an exhilarating pixel art beat ‘em up that plunges players into a gritty, adrenaline-fueled fight for loyalty, survival, and justice. Set against the backdrop of a chaotic cityscape, this game tells the story of two street-smart teenagers, Leo and Maya, who find themselves pitted against a ruthless network of rival gangs when their mentor and the charismatic leader of their own gang, The Shadows, is kidnapped.
    
The game opens with a chilling scene: The Shadows’ stronghold has been ambushed, leaving behind nothing but destruction and a cryptic message scrawled on the walls by the assailants. The news hits Leo and Maya like a punch to the gut—their leader, the one who pulled them off the streets and showed them a life beyond fear and desperation, is now a captive. The rival gangs have united, each with its own sinister reasons for wanting The Shadows to fall. But Leo and Maya aren’t about to let their family crumble without a fight.
    
As players journey through *Battle Park High*, they’ll guide Leo and Maya through a labyrinthine world filled with pulsating synthwave music, explosive street brawls, and unexpected alliances. From abandoned amusement parks turned makeshift arenas to neon-lit rooftops patrolled by ruthless enforcers, every level pushes players deeper into the heart of gang warfare. Each rival gang has its own flair—The Rust Hounds, masters of brute force with their lead pipes and chains, and The Velvet Knives, a cunning group who rule the city’s dark alleys with unmatched agility.
    
But *Battle Park High* isn’t just about the fights; it’s a narrative-driven experience that forces players to confront the thin line between loyalty and ambition. As the story unfolds, Leo and Maya will uncover secrets that threaten to fracture The Shadows from within, raising the stakes far beyond a mere rescue mission. The duo must rely not only on their combat prowess but on the bonds they’ve forged—and their wits—to navigate shifting loyalties, betrayals, and the ruthless hierarchy of the streets.
