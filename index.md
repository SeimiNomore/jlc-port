### Artworks Codex 
Conception - Feb 2019 / present

> The latest chapter of my fine art journey embodies the continuous evolution of my personal mythos and artistic metamorphosis. Each piece serves as a reflection of my inner transformation, weaving together narratives that transcend time and space. Through a delicate balance of symbolism, esoteric undertones, and deeply personal insights, my work explores the interplay between the past and the present, myth and reality, and the unseen forces that shape human experience. This body of work not only marks a profound milestone in my creative expression but also redefines the boundaries of how I tell my story.

### Art Direction
Conception - Sept. 2006 / 2016

> I collaborated with artists across a range of mediums to support and refine their creative practices. Through these partnerships, I gained hands-on experience in understanding the unique techniques and perspectives that each art form demands. This involvement not only deepened my appreciation for diverse artistic expressions but also enhanced my ability to contribute effectively to creative projects, bridging ideas and execution across various crafts.
